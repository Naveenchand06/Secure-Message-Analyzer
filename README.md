# Safe Message Analyzer

Introducing a new Flutter project that focuses on analyzing messages on your mobile device and categorizing them into different groups such as safe, unsure, and messages with links. The project also includes a feature to analyze the safety of the links within the messages. If a link is deemed safe, you will have the option to copy it, but if it is flagged as unsafe, copying will be restricted.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

### Setup

## Clone the repository

Click on the code button which is in green color and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project).

It will download the code in the directory in which you are executing this command. You'll see a folder named _Secure-Message-Analyzer_

Now, open that folder in your text editor.

Create a `.env` file and add `API_KEY`

See `.env.example` file
